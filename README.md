# Personal website | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & Bootstrap | Responsivines

A brief description of how I made this, what this project does, and who it's for.

-   **UI/UX Design - Figma:** The UI/UX design was done by me. I research, observe, and think about building an eye-catching website for personal branding and a showcase for my portfolios. However, the design was inspired by A. Mahamud. Thanks to him.
-   **Front End Design/Develop:** I didn't use much except HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & Bootstrap, while the website is just a landing page. But soon I'll add **_VueJs_** as a front-end framework.
-   **BackEnd:** I just completed the task, and I intend to use **_Laravel (a PHP framework)_**. Everything will have a super-dynamic and user-friendly dashboard.
    #### What technologies will I use for the backend?
          - Laravel
          - MySQL
          - cPanel(for deployment using SSH & git)
-   **What are the benefits for you?** You will explore my projects, how I develop them, the quality of the codes, how the websites interact, the user experience and interface, and more.
-   **What are the benefits of working with me?:** I'm a self-dependent website developer. Working with full dedication and patience. Reusability codes and easy-to-understand codes. Reasonable budget.
